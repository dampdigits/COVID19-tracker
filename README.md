# COVID19-tracker
A popular way to track COVID cases is using a 7-day average. Some states in USA only record cases once a week, so using a 7-day average is much more accurate than daily numbers. In this program, a [New York Times repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of live, cumulative COVID data has been used to calculate new daily cases.

The program creates a 7-day average, and compare this weekâ€™s average to the previous week.
